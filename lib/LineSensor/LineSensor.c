 * LineSensor.c 
 * Devices: TM4C123
 * Description: Low level driver for QTR Reflectance Sensor
 * Authors: Dario Jimenez
 * Last Modified: 06/28/2021
 * 
 * QTR reflectance Sensor information:
 * This sensor detects the reflectance of an object.
 * For instance: white reflects a high amount of light, hence the sensor will detect a white object as high reflectance.
 * In the other hand, black reflects low amount of light, hence sensor will detect a black/dark object as low reflectance.
 * 
 * Power Specifications:
 * Connect VCC to 3.3V or 5V (VDD)
 * 100 mA input
 * It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use a 5V, 5A regulator at the power input.
 * 
 * Hardware:
 * Connect pins on sensor to analog pins
 * The optimal distance for the sensors is 0.125" (3 mm)
 * Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.25" (6mm)
 * 
 * Summary of Driver:
 * This driver initializes a specified number of sensors on the QTR as analog inputs;
 * returns the raw data from the sensor as an array of 16-bit values
 * */

 * 		   2) NO_ERROR (0) if everything was initialized properly

 * note: If an incorrect number is given for numPins parameter, the sensor will not work properly.
 * 		 Similarly, if the pins are not given in the proper order, the sensor will not work properly
