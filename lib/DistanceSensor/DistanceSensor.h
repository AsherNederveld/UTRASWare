 * Description: Low-level driver for GP2Y0A60SZ analog distance sensor
 * Authors: Dario Jimenez
 * Last Modified: 07/22/21
 * 
 * GP2Y0A60SZLF Analog Distance Sensor information:
 *    - 1 VCC pin: connect to the +3.3V pin or can be powered at 5V or 3V depending on the sensor
 *    - 1 GND pin
 *    - 1 OUT pin: ADC analog output with a range of 0V-3V at 5V VCC or 0V-1.6V at 3V VCC
 *    - 1 EN pin: optional pin to enable and disable sensor
 * 
 *    - Range of measuring distance: 10 cm to 150 cm (4'' to 60'')
 *    - update period: 16.5 ± 4 ms
 * 
 *    -Available TM4C123 pins for OUT pin: PE5, PE3, PE2, PE1, PE0, PD3, PD2, PD1, PD0
 * 
 * Summary of driver:
 *    - this driver allows you to initialize Distance sensors, read an unsigned 16-bit value from 
 *      the sensors, and set up periodic interrupts where data is read from a sensor at a desired 
 *      frequency.

 * 
 * Output: no output, data will be stored in the "data" variable from DistanceSensor struct at the given frequency

 * Note: In order to correctly read all values from the sensor, your interrupt frequency must be more than twice the

 * Note: In order to change the interrupt of a sensor that has already been set as an interrupt, you must disable the 
 *       interrupt first calling the "DistaceSensor_DisableInterrupt" function passing the desired sensor as parameter
